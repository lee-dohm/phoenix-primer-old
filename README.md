This is mostly an experiment in Elixir macro code generation. It is not intended for production use. You have been warned.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed by adding `phoenix_primer` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
